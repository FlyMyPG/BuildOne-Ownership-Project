## How do I make my prints better?
  
### Filament Selection:
  - Use only PLA at first  
  - Generic Filament:  
    - There is very little "bad" filament on the market any more, so even inexpensive brands from reputable retailers should be great.  
    - That said, beware of "too good to be true" prices on markets like eBay or AliExpress.  
    - Amazon:  
      - Treat "Amazon's Choice" items like any others.  It's just advertising, a tag sellers can purchace.  
      - "Amazon Brand" and "AmazonBasics" mean it was made just for Amazon, and generally represents good quality and value.  
  - Recommended Brands:  
    - Best Bang-for-the-Buck:  Solutech, eSun, Ziro  
    - Masters of Filament:  Hatchboxx, Prusament, Proto-pasta, Polymaker, Colorfabb, Ninjaflex (Flexible, TPE/TPU)
    
### Filament Settings:  
  - Start with whatever temperatures the manufacturer recommends, and default slicer speeds.  
  - Print a Speed Tower
