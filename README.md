## How do I make my prints better?
  
### Filament Selection:
  - Use only PLA at first  
  - Generic Filament:  
    - There is very little "bad" filament on the market any more, so even inexpensive brands from reputable retailers should give excellent results.  
    - That said, beware of "too good to be true" prices on markets like eBay or AliExpress.  
    - Amazon:  
      - "Amazon's Choice" means nothing special. It is just advertising, a tag sellers can purchace.  
      - "Amazon Brand" and "AmazonBasics" mean it was made just for Amazon, and generally represents good quality and value.  
  - Recommended Brands:  
    - Bang-for-the-Buck:  Solutech, eSun, Ziro  
    - Masters of Filament:  Hatchboxx, Prusament, Proto-pasta, Polymaker, Colorfabb, Ninjaflex (Flexible, TPE/TPU)
    
### Filament Settings:  
  - The Basics:  
    - Start with whatever temperatures the manufacturer recommends, with the default slicer speeds.  Only go further when the cause of a bad print has been specifically traced to filament (rather than slicer) issues.   
  - Pursuing Perfection:  
    - Print various Calibration Towers to identify and fix/optimize many common problems, including speed, nozzle temperature and part cooling:

### Slicer Settings:  
  - Speed / Quality:  
    - Line Width  
    - Layer Thickness  
    - Infill  
    - Wall Thickness

## Dual-Filament  

### Overview  
There are multiple ways to use multiple filaments in a single print.  Here's a great overview:  
https://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2018/3/16/the-several-methods-of-dual-extrusion  

The BuildOne dual-filament option is a "filament switcher", not a "dual hot-end" system. Like most other dual-filament systems it has a second filament feed system, but comes with some advantages and disadvantages:  
Advantages:  
  - No second hot-end.  
  - No special firmware.  
  - Fast and Easy to add.  
Disadvantages:  
  - Slow for each color change.  Steps include:  
    - Full filament retraction  
    - Full and full feed  
    - Purge of prior color from nozzle  
  - Filament purge wastes filament, often more than is used by the print itself!  
  
  _**Mod Hint:** If you also purchased the BuildOne Spare Parts Add-On, it includes a second hot-end that can be used to create a true dual hot-end mod for the BuildOne._
